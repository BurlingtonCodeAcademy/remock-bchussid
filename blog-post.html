    <p>Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? It seems
      like
      only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. But anyhoo, can you believe that the
      only
      reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I'm going to
      run this through again on "pots and pans."</p>

      Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? It seems like

      Let's see some bananas and nuts! Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even
      including Buster's Swatch. But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken in a
      little bit. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. You want
      your belt to buckle, not your chair. I'm gonna go get sexy. </p>

    <p>I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. It's
      a
      jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong?

      We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. [Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I'm white! No, no, it's
      pronounced a-nal-ra-pist.

      The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican.
      And she's Colombian or something.

      I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and
      spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met? Uncle Gob, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens
      of times. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun.

      Look what the homosexuals have done to me! You can't just comb that out and reset it? Happy Franklin Friday.
    </p>

    <p>Boy, I sure feel like a Mary without a Peter and a Paul. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by
      his drainage shunt? Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unlessâ€¦ did you want me to follow you to your car? She's
      a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. It was for me. I was going to smoke the
      marijuana like a cigarette. Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp. The guy runs a
      prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor
      said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus.

      Heart attack never stopped old big bear. You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night,
      start messing with your junk? Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer.
      She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. I may have
      committed some light treason.

      You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of
      Spanish. I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy? Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy
      sometimes. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! We'll have to find something to do so that people
      can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. That was Tom Cruise,
      the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. GENE!! [screams]
