      <p>PLACEHOLDER: Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities?
        It seems
        like
        only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. But anyhoo, can you believe that the
        only
        reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I'm going to
        run this through again on "pots and pans."</p>

      <p>PLACEHOLDER: Let's see some bananas and nuts! Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's
        not even
        including
        Buster's Swatch. But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken in a little
        bit.
        The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. You want your belt
        to
        buckle, not your chair. I'm gonna go get sexy. </p>

      <p>I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar.
        It's
        a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

        four years
        of Spanish. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. That was Tom
        Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. GENE!! [screams]</p>
